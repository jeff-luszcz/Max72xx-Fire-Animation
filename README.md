## Synopsis

This Arduino sketch creates a fire animation on a 8x8 LED matrix module controlled by a MAX72XX

## Motivation

These modules are fairly inexpensive (~$6 US) and only require a few pins to control 64
LEDs arranged in a 8x8 matrix.

A common demo is create a flame or fire-like animation on the device.

I wasn't able to find one that worked with the monochromatic MAX72XX controlled devices so made this.

A search on the standard retailers will find devices that should work, typically using 
a description similar to:

MAX7219 Dot Led Matrix MCU Control LED Display Module

## Installation

Install the LedControl library in order to run this sketch
